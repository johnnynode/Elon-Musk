MICE IN SPAC
---

>　Elon Musk turned thirty in june 2001, and the birthday hit him hard. "I'm no longer a child prodigy," he told Justine, only half joking. That same month X.com officially changed its name to PayPal, providing a harsh reminder that the compnay had been ripped away from Musk and given to someone else to run. The start-up life, which Musk described as akin to "eating glass and staring into the abyss," had gotten old and so had Silicon Valley. It felt like Musk was living inside a trade show where everyone worked in the technology industry and talked all the time about funding, IPOs, and chasing big paydays. People liked to brag about the carazy hours they worked, and Justine would just laugh, knowing Musk had lived a more extreme version of the Silicon Valley lifestyle than they could imagine. "I had friends who complained that their husbands came home at seven or eight," she said. "Elon would come home at eleven and work some more. People didn't always get the sacrifice he made in order to be where he was."

>　The idea of escaping this incredibly lucrative rat race started to grow more and more appealing. Musk's entire life had been about chasing a bigger stage, and Palo Alto seemed more like a stepping-stone than a final destination. The couple dicided to move south and begin their family and the next chapter of their lives in Los Angeles.

>　"There's an element to him that likes the style and the excitement and color of place like L.A.," said Justine. "Elon likes to be where the action is." A small group of Musk's friends who felt similarly had also decamped to Los Angeles for what would be a wild couple of years.

>　It wasn't just Los Angeles's glitz and grandeur that attacted Musk. It was also the call of space. After being pushed out of PayPal, Musk hadd started to revisit his childhood fantasies around rocket ships and space travel and to think that he might have a greater calling than creating Internet services. The changes in his attitude and thinking soon became obvious to his friends, including a group of PayPal executives who had gathered in Las Vegas one weekend to celebrate the company's success. "We're all hanging out in this cabana at the Hard Rock Cafe, and Elon is there reading some obscure Soviet rocket manual that was all moldy and looked like it had been bought on eBay," said Kevin Hartz, an early PayPal investor. "He was studying it and talking openly about space travel and changing the world."
