MICE IN SPAC
---

>　Elon Musk turned thirty in june 2001, and the birthday hit him hard. "I'm no longer a child prodigy," he told Justine, only half joking. That same month X.com officially changed its name to PayPal, providing a harsh reminder that the compnay had been ripped away from Musk and given to someone else to run. The start-up life, which Musk described as akin to "eating glass and staring into the abyss," had gotten old and so had Silicon Valley. It felt like Musk was living inside a trade show where everyone worked in the technology industry and talked all the time about funding, IPOs, and chasing big paydays. People liked to brag about the carazy hours they worked, and Justine would just laugh, knowing Musk had lived a more extreme version of the Silicon Valley lifestyle than they could imagine. "I had friends who complained that their husbands came home at seven or eight," she said. "Elon would come home at eleven and work some more. People didn't always get the sacrifice he made in order to be where he was."

>　The idea of escaping this incredibly lucrative rat race started to grow more and more appealing. Musk's entire life had been about chasing a bigger stage, and Palo Alto seemed more like a stepping-stone than a final destination. The couple dicided to move south and begin their family and the next chapter of their lives in Los Angeles.
>
>　"There's an element to him that likes the style and the excitement and color of place like L.A.," said Justine. "Elon likes to be where the action is." A small group of Musk's friends who felt similarly had also decamped to Los Angeles for what would be a wild couple of years.
>
>　It wasn't just Los Angeles's glitz and grandeur that attacted Musk. It was also the call of space. After being pushed out of PayPal, Musk hadd started to revisit his childhood fantasies around rocket ships and space travel and to think that he might have a greater calling than creating Internet services. The changes in his attitude and thinking soon became obvious to his friends, including a group of PayPal executives who had gathered in Las Vegas one weekend to celebrate the company's success. "We're all hanging out in this cabana at the Hard Rock Cafe, and Elon is there reading some obscure Soviet rocket manual that was all moldy and looked like it had been bought on eBay," said Kevin Hartz, an early PayPal investor. "He was studying it and talking openly about space travel and changing the world."

>　Musk had picked Los Angeles with intent. It gave him access to space or at least the space industry. Southern California's mild, consistent weather had made it a favored city of the aeronautics industry since the 1920s, when the Lockheed Aircraft Company set up shop in Hollywood. Howard Hughes, the U.S. Air Force, NASA, Boeing, and myriad other people and organizations have performed much of their manufacturing and cutting-edge experimentation in and around Los Angeles. Today the city remains a major hub for the military's aernonautics work and commericial acitity. While Musk didn't know exactly what he wanted to do in space, he realized that just by being in Los Angeles he would be surrounded by the world's top aeronautics thinkers. They could help him refine any ideas, and there would be plenty of recruits to join his next venture.
>
>　Musk's first interactions with the aeronautics community were with an eclectic collection of space enthusiasts, members of a nonprofit group called the Mars Society. Dedicated to exploring and settling the Red Planet, the Mars Society planned to hold a fund-raiser in mid-2001. The $500-per-plate event was to take place at he house of one of the well-off Mars Society members and invitations to the usual characters had been mailed out. What stunned Robert Zubrin, the head of the group, was the reply from someone named Elon Musk, whom no one could remember inviting. "He gave us a check for five thousand dollars," Zubrin said. "That made everyone take notice." Zubrin began researching Musk, determined he was rich, and invited him for coffee ahead of the dinner. "I wanted to make sure he knew the projects we had under way," Zubrin siad. He proceeded to regale Musk with tales of the research center the society had built in the Arctic to mimic the tough conditions off Mars and the experiments they had been runnign for something called the Translife Mission, in which there would be a spinning capsule orbiting Earth that was piloted by a crew of mice. "It would spin to give them on-third gravity - the same you would have on Mars - and they would live there and reproduce," Zubrin told Musk.

>　When it was time for dinner, Zubrin placed Musk at the VIP table next to himself, the director and space buff James Cameron, and Carol Stoker, a planetary scientist for NASA with a deep interest in Mars. "Elon is so youthful-looking and at that time he lloked like a little boy," Stoker said. "Cameron was chatting him up right away to invest in his next movie, and Zubrin was trying to get him to make a big donation to the Mars Society" In return for being hounded for cash, Musk probed about for ideas and contacts. Stoker's husband was an aerospace engineer at NASA working on a concept for an airplane that would glide over Mars looking for water. Musk loved that. "He was much more intense than some of the other millionaires," Zubrin said. "He didn't know a lot about space, but he had a scientific mind. He wanted to know exactly what was being planned in regards to Mars and what the significance would be." Musk took to the Mars Society right away and joined its board of directors. He donated another $100,000 to fund a research station in the desert as well.

>　Musk's friens were not entirely sure what to make of his mental state. He'd lost a tremendous amount of weight fighting off malaria and looked almost skeletal. With little prompting, Musk would start expounding on his desire to do something meaningful with his life - something lasting. His next move had to be eighter in solar or in space. "He said,'The logical thing to happen next is solar, but I can't figure out how to make any money out of it,'" said George Zachary, the investor and close friend of Musk's, recalling a lunch date at the time. "Then he started talking about space, and I thought he meant office space like a real estate play." Musk had actually started thinking bigger than the Mars Society. Rather than send a few mice into Earth's orbit, Musk wanted to send them to Mars. Some very rough calculations done at the time suggested that the journey would cost $15 million. "He asked if I thought that was crazy," Zachary said. "I asked,'Do the mice come back? Because, if they don't, yeah, most people will think that's crazy.'" As it turned out, the mice were not only meant to go to Mars and come back but were also meant to procreate along the way, during a journey that would take months. Jeff Skoll, another one of Musk's friends who made a fortune at eBay, pointed out that the fornicating mice would need a hell of a lot of cheese and bought Musk a giant wheel of Le Brouere, a type of Gruyere.

>　Musk did not mind becoming the butt of cheese jokes. The more he thought about space, the more important its exploration seemed to him. He felt as if the public had lost some of its ambition and hope for the future. The average person might see space exploration as a waste of time and effort and rib him for talking about the subject, but Musk thought about interplanetary travel in a very earnest way. He wanted to inspire the masses and reinvigorate their passion for science, conquest, and the promise of technology.
>
>　His fears that mankind had lost much of its will to push the boundaries were reinforced one day when Musk went to the NASA website. He'd expected to find a detailed plan for exploring mars and instead found bupkis. "At first I thought, jeez, maybe I'm just looking in the wrong place," Musk once told Wired. "Why was there no plan, no schedule? There was nothing. It seemd crazy." Musk believed that the very idea of America was intertwined with humanity's desire to explore. He found it sad that the American agency tasked with doing audacious things in space and exploring new frountiers as its mission seemed to have no serious interest in investigating Mars at all. The spirit of Manifest Destiny had been deflated or maybe even come to a depressing end, and hardly anyone seemed to care.
>
>　Like so many quests to revitalize America's soul and bring hope to all of mankind, Musk's journey began in a hotel conference room. By this time, Musk had built up a decent network of contacts in the space industry, and he brought the best of them together at a series of salons - sometimes at the Renaissane hotel at the Los Angeles airport and sometimes at the Sheraton hotel in Palo Alto. Musk had no formal business plan for these people to debate. He mostly wanted them to help him develop the mice-to-Mars idea or at least to come up with something comparable. Musk hoped to hit on a grand gesture for mankind - some type of event that would capture the world's attention, get people thinking about Mars again, and have them reflet on man's potential. The scientists and luminaries at the meetings were to figure out a spectacle that would be technically feasible at a price tag of approximately $20 million. Musk resigned from his position as a director of the Mars Society and announced his own organization - the Life to Mars Foundation.

>　The collection of talent attending these sessions in 2001 was impressive. Scientists showed up from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, or JPL. James Cameron appeared, lending some celebrity to the affair. Also attending was Michael Griffin, whose academic credentials were spectacular and included degrees in aerospace engineering, electrical engineering, civil engineering, and applied physics. Griffin had worked for the CIA's venture capital arm called In-Q-Tel, at NASA, at JPL and was just in the process of leaving Orbital Sciences Corporation, a maker of statellites and spacecraft, where he had been chief technical officer and the general manager of the space systems group. It could be argued that no one on the planet knew more about the realities of getting things into space than Griffin, and he was working for Musk as space thinker in chief.(Four years later, in 2005, Griffin took over as head of NASA.)

>　The experts were thrilled th have another rich guy appear who was willing to fund something interesting in space. They happily debated the merits and feasibility of sending up rodents and watching them hump. But, as the discussion wore on, a consensus stated to build around pursuing a different project - something called "Mars Oasis." Under this plan, Musk would buy a rocket and use it to shoot what amounted to a robotic green house to Mars. A group of researchers had already been working on a space-ready growth chamber for plants. The idea was to modify their structure, so that it could open up briefly and suck in some of the Martian regolith, or soil, and then use it to grow a plant, which would in turn produce the first oxygen on Mars. Much to Musk's liking, this new plan seemed both ostentatious and feasible.
>
>　Musk wanted the structure to have a window and a way to send a video feedback to Earth, so that people could watch the plant grow. The group also talked about sending out kits to students around the country who would grow their own plants simultaneously and take notice, for example, that the Martian plant could grow twice as high as its Earth-bound counterpart in the same amount of time. "This concept had been floating around in various forms for a while," said Dave Bearden, a space industry veteran who attended the meetings. "It would be, yes, there is life on Mars, and we put it there. The hope was that it might turn on a light for thousands of kids that this place is not that hostile. Then they might start thinking, Maybe we should go there." Musk's enthusiasm for the idea started to inspire the group, many of whom had grown cynical about anything novel happening in space again. "He's a very smart, very driven guy with a huge ego," Bearden siad. "At one point someone mentioned that he might become Time magazine's Man of the Year, and you could see him light up. He has this belief that he is the guy who can change the world."
>
>　The main thing troubling the spce experts was Musk's budget. Following the salons, it seemed like Musk wanted to spend somewhere between $20 million and $30 million on the stunt, and everyone knew that the cost of a rocket launch alone would eat up that money and then some. "In my mind, you needed two hundred million dollars to do it right," Bearden said. "But people were reluctant to bring too much reality into the situation too early and just get the whole idea killed." Then there were the immense engineering challenges that would need solving. "To have a big window on this thing was a real thermal problem," Bearden said. "You could not keep the container warm enough to keep anything alive." Scooping Martian soil into the structure seemed not only hard to do physically but also like a flat-out bad idea since the regolith would be toxic. For a while, the scientists debated growing he plant in a nutrient-rich gel instead, but that felt like cheating and like it might undermine the whole point of the endeavor. Even the optimistic moments were awash in unknowns. One scientist found some very resilient mustard seeds and thought they could possibly survive a treated version of the Martian soil. "There was a pretty big downside if the plant didn't survive," Bearden said. "You have this dead garden on Mars that ends up giving off the opposite of the intended effect."
>
>　Musk never flinched. He turned some of the volunteer thinkers into consultants, and put them to work on the plant machine's design. He also plotted a trip to Russia to find out exactly how much a launch would cost. Musk intended to buy a refurbished intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM, from the Russians and use that as his launch vehicle. For help with this, Musk reached out to Jim Cantrell, an unusual fellow who had done a mix of classified and unclassified work for the United States and other governments. Among other claims to fame, Cantrell had been accused of espionage and placed under house arrest in 1996 by the Russians after a satellite deal went awry. "After a couple of weeks, Al Gore made some calls, and it got worked out," Cantrell said. "I didn't want anything to do with the Russians again ever." Musk had other ideas.
>
>　Cantrell was driving his convertible on a hot July evening in Utah when a call came in. "This guy in a funny accent said, 'I really need to talk to you. I am a billionaire. I am going to start a space program.'" Cantrell could not hear Musk well - he thought his name was Ian Musk - and said he would call back once he got home. The two men didn't exactly trust each other at the outset. Musk refused to give Cantrell his cell phone number and made the call from his fax machine. Cantrell found Musk both intriguing and all to eager. "He asked if there was an airport near me and if I could meet the next day," Cantrell said. "My red flags started going off." Fearing one of his enemies was trying to orchestrate an elaborate setup, Cantrell told Musk to meet him at the Salt Lake City ariport, where he would rent a conference room near the Delta lounge. "I wanted him to meet me behind security so he couldn't pack a gun," Cantrell said. When the meeting fianlly took place, Musk and Cantrell hit it off. Musk rolled out his "humans need to become a multiplanetary species" speech, and Cantrell said that if Musk was really serious, he'd be willing to go to Russia - again - and help buy a rocket.
>
>　In late October 2001, Musk, Cantrell, and Adeo Ressi, Musk's friend from college, boarded a commercial flight to Moscow. Ressi had been playing the role of Musk's guardian and trying to ascertain whether his best friend had started to lose his mind. Compilation videos of rocket exploding were made, and interventions were held with Musk's friends trying to talk him out of wasting his money. While these measures failed, Adeo went along to Russia to try to contain Musk as best as he could. "Adeo would call me to the side and say, 'What Elon is doing is insane. A philanthropic gesture? That's crazy,'" Cantrell said. "He was seriously worried but was down with the trip." And why not? The men were heading to Russia at the height of its freewheeling post Soviet days when rich guys could apparently buy space missiles on the open market.
>
>　Team Musk would grow to include Mike Griffin, and meet with Russians three times over a period of four months. The group set up a few meetings with companies like NPO Lavochkin, which had made probes intended for Mars and Venus for the Russian Federal Space Agency, and Kosmotras, a commercial rocket launcher. The apppintments all seemed to go the same way, following Russian decorum. The Russians, who often skip breakfast, would ask to meet around 11 A.M. at their offices for an early lunch. Then there would be small talk for an hour or more as the meeting attendees picked over a spread of sandwiches, sausages, and, of course, vodka. At some point during this process, Griffin usually started to lose his patience. "He suffers fools very poorly," Cantrell said. "He's looking around and wondering when we're going to get down to fucking business." The answer was not soon. After lunch came a lengthy smoking and coffee drinking period. Once all of the tables were cleared, the Russian is charge would turn to Musk and ask, "What is it you're interested in buying?" The big windup may not have bothered Musk as much if the Russians had taken him more seriously. "They looked at us like we were not credible people," Cantrell said. "One of their chief designers spit on me and Elon because he thought we were full of shit."
>
>　The most intense meeting occurred in an ornate, neglected, prerevolutionary building near downtown Moscow. The vodka shots started - "To space!" "To America!" - while Musk sat on $20 million, which he hoped would be enough to buy three ICBMs that could be retooled to go to space. Buzzed from the vodka, Musk asked point-blank how much a missile would cost. The reply: $8 million each. Musk countered, offering $8 million for two. "They sat there and looked at him," Cantrell said. "And said something like, 'Young boy. No.' They also intimatched that he didn't have the money." At this point, Musk had decided the Russians were either not serious about doing business or determined to part a dot-com millionaire from as much of his money as possible. He stormed out of the meeting.
>
>　The Team Musk mood could not have been worse. It was near the end of February 2002, and they went outside to hail a cab and drove straight to the airport surrounded by the snow and dreck of the Moscow winter. Inside the cab, no one talked. Musk had come to Russia filled with optimism about putting on a great show for mankind and was now leaving exasperated and disappointed by human nature. The Russians were the only ones with rockets that could possibly fit within Musk's budget. "It was a long drive," Cantrell said. "We sat there in silence looking at the Russian peasants shopping in the snow." The somber mood lingered all the way to the plane, until the drink cart arrived. "You always feel particularly good when the wheels life off in Moscow," Cantrell said. "It's like, 'My God. I made it." So, Griffin and I got drinks and clinked our glasses." Musk sat in the row in front of them, typing on his computer. "We're thinking, Fucking nerd. What can he be doing now?" At which point Musk wheeled around and flashed a spreadsheet he'd created. "Hey guy," he said, "I think we can build this rocket ourselves."
