>ã€€The public first met Elon Reeve musk in 1984. The south African trade publication PC and Office Technology published the source code to a video game Musk had designed. Called Blastar, the science-fiction-inspired space game required 167 lines of instructions to run. This was back in the day when early conmputer users were required to type out commands to make their machines do much of anything. In that context, Musk's game did not shine as a marvel of computer science but it certainly surpassed what most tewlve-year-olds were kicking out at the time. Its coverage in the magazine netted Musk five hundred dollars and provided some early hints about his character. The Blastear spread on page 69 of the magazine shows that the young man wanted to go by the sci-fi-author-sounding name E.R. Musk and that he already had visions of grand conquests dancing in his head. The brief explainer states, "In this game you have to destroy an alien space freighter, which is carrrying deadly Hydrogen Bombs and Status Beam Machines. This game makes good use of sprites and animation, and in this sense makes the listing worth reading." (As of this writing, not even the Internet knows what "status beam machines" are.)
