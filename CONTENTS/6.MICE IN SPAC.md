MICE IN SPAC

>ã€€Elon Musk turned thirty in june 2001, and the birthday hit him hard. "I'm no longer a child prodigy," he told Justine, only half joking. That same month X.com officially changed its name to PayPal, providing a harsh reminder that the compnay had been ripped away from Musk and given to someone else to run. The start-up life, which Musk described as akin to "eating glass and staring into the abyss," had gotten old and so had Silicon Valley. It felt like Musk was living inside a trade show where everyone worked in the technology industry and talked all the time about funding, IPOs, and chasing big paydays. People liked to brag about the carazy hours they worked, and Justine would just laugh, knowing Musk had lived a more extreme version of the Silicon Valley lifestyle than they could imagine. "I had friends who complained that their husbands came home at seven or eight," she said. "Elon would come home at eleven and work some more. People didn't always get the sacrifice he made in order to be where he was."
