ELON'S FIRST START-UP.md
---

>　In the summer of 1994. Musk and his brother. Kimbal, took their first steps toward becoming honest-to-God Americans. They set off on a road trip across the country.
>
>　Kimbal had been working as a franchisee for College Pro Painters and done well for himself, running what amounted to a small business. He sold off his part of the franchise and pooled the money with what Musk had on hand to buy a beat-up 1970s BMW 320i. The brothers began their trip near san francisco in August, as temperatures in California soared. The first part of the drive took them down to Needles, a city in the Mojave Desert. There they experienced the sweaty thrill of 120-degree weather in a car with no air-conditioning and learned to love pit stops at Carl's Jr.burger joints, where they spent hours recuperating in the cold.

>　The trip provided plenty of time for your typical twenty something hijinks and raging captialist daydreaming. The Web had just started to become accessible to the public thanks to the rise of directroy sites like Yahoo! and tools like Netscape's browser. The brothers were tuned in to the Internet and thought they might like to start a company together doing something on the Web. From California to Colorado, Wyoming, South Dakota, and Illinois, they took turns driving, brainstorming, and talking shit before heading back east to get Musk to school that fall. The best idea to arise from the journey was an online network for doctors. This wasn't meant to be something as ambitious as electronic health records but more of a system for physicians to exchange information and collaborate. "It seemed like the medical industry was one that could be disrupted," Kimbal said. "I went to work on a business plan and the sales and marketing side of it later, but it didn't fly. We didn't love it."

>　Musk had spent the earlier part of that summer in Silicon Valley, holding down a pair of internships. Byday, he worked at Pinnacle Resarch Institute. Based in Los Gatos, Pinnacle was a much-ballyhooed start-up with a team of scientists exploring ways in which ultracapacitors could be used as a revolutionary fuel source in electric and hybird vehicles. The work also veered - at leat conceptually - into  more bizarre territory. Musk could talk at length about how ultracapacitors might be used to build laster based sidearms in the tradition fo Star Wars and just about any other futuristic film. The laser guns would release rounds of enormous energy, and then the shooter would replace an ultracapacitor at the base of the gun, much like swapping out a clip of bullets, and start blasting away again. Ultracapacitors also looked promising as the power supplies of missiles. They were more resilient than batteries under the mechanical stresses of a launch and would hold a more consistent charge over long periods of time. Musk fell in love with the work at Pinnacle and began using it as the basis for some of his business plan experiments at Penn and for his industrialist fantasies.

>　In the evenings, Musk headed to Rocket Science Games, a start-up based in Palo Alto that wanted to create the most advanced video games ever made by moving them off cartridges and onto CDs that could hold more information. The CDs would in theory allow them to bring Hollywood-style storytelling and production quality to the games. A team of budding all-stars who were a mix of engineeers and film people was assembled to pull off the work. Tony Fadell, who would later drive much of the development of both the iPod and iPhone at Apple, worked at Rocket Science ,as did the guys who developed the QuickTime multimedia software for Apple. They also had people who worked on the original Star Wars effects at Industrial Light & Magic and some who did games at LucasArts Entertainment. Rocket Science gave Musk a flavor for what Silicon Valley had to offer both from a talent and culture perspective. There were people working at the office twenty-four hours a day, and they didn't think it at all odd that Musk would turn up around 5 P.M. every evening to start his second job "We brought him in to write some very menial lowlevel code," said Peter Barrett, an Australian engineer who helped start the company. "he was completely unflappable. After a short while, I don't think anyone was giving him any direction, and he ended up making what he wanted to make."

>　Sepecifically, Musk had been asked to write the drivers that would let joysticks and mice communicate with various computers and games. Drivers are the same types of annoying files that you have to install to get a printer or camera working with a home computer - true grunt work. A self-taught programmer, Musk fancied himself quite good at coding and assigned himself to more ambitious jobs. "I was basically trying to figure out how you could multitask stuff, so you could read video from a CD, while running a game at the same time," Musk said. "At the time, you could do one or the other. It was this complicated bit of assembly programming." Complicated indeed. Musk had to issue commands that spoke directly to a computer's main microprocessor and fiddled with the most basic functions that made the machine work. Bruce Leak, the former lead engineer behind Apple's QuickTime, had overseen the hiring of Musk and marveled at his ability to pull all-nighters. "he had boundless energy," Leak said, "kids these days have no idea about hardware or how stuff works, but he had a PC hacker background and was not afraid to just go figure things out."
