ELON'S WORLD
---

　Do you think I'm insane? This question came from Elon Musk near the very end
of a long dinner we shared at a high-end seafood restaurant
in Silicon Valley. I'd gotten to the restaurant first and settled
down with a gin and tonic,knowing Musk would-as ever-be
late. After about fifteen minutes,Musk showed up wearing leather
shoes, designer jeans,and a plaid dress shirt. Musk stands six foot
one but ask anyone who knows him and they'll confirm that he
seems much bigger than that. He's absurdly broad-shouldered,
sturdy,and thick. You'd figure he would use this frame to his
advantage and perform an alpha-male strut when entering a
room. Instead,he tends to be almost sheepish. It's heard tilted
slightly down while walking,a quick handshake hello after reaching
the table,and then butt in seat. From there, Musk needs a few
minutes before he warms up and looks at ease.
　Musk asked me to dinner for a negotiation of sorts.
Eighteen months earlier,I'd informed him of my plans to write a book
about him,and he'd informed me of his plans not to cooperate.
His rejection stung but thrust me into dogged reporter mode. If I
had to do this book without him,so be it. Plenty of people had left
Musk's companies,Tesla Motors and SpaceX,and would talk,and
after another,month after month, and two hundred or so people
into the process,I heard from Musk once again. He called me at
home and declared that things could go one of two ways:he could
make my life very difficult or he could help with the project after
all. He'd be willing to cooperate if he could read the book before
it went to publication, and could add footnotes throughout it. He
would not meddle with my text, but he wanted the chance to set
the record straight in spots that he deemed factually inaccurate.
I understood where this was coming from. Musk wanted a measure
of control over his life's story. He's also wired like a scientist
and suffers mental anguish at the sight of a factual error. A mistake
on a printed page would gnaw at his soul-forever. While I could
understand his perspective,I could not let him read the book,for
professional,personal,and practical reasons. Musk has his version
of the truth,and it's not always the version of the truth that
the rest of the world shares. He's prone to verbose answers to
even the simplest of questions as well,and the thought of thirty-page
footnotes seemed all too real. Still,we agreed to have dinner,
chat all this out,and see where it left us.
