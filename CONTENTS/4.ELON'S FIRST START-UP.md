ELON'S FIRST START-UP.md
---

>　In the summer of 1994. Musk and his brother. Kimbal, took their first steps toward becoming honest-to-God Americans. They set off on a road trip across the country.
>
>　Kimbal had been working as a franchisee for College Pro Painters and done well for himself, running what amounted to a small business. He sold off his part of the franchise and pooled the money with what Musk had on hand to buy a beat-up 1970s BMW 320i. The brothers began their trip near san francisco in August, as temperatures in California soared. The first part of the drive took them down to Needles, a city in the Mojave Desert. There they experienced the sweaty thrill of 120-degree weather in a car with no air-conditioning and learned to love pit stops at Carl's Jr.burger joints, where they spent hours recuperating in the cold.

>　The trip provided plenty of time for your typical twenty something hijinks and raging captialist daydreaming. The Web had just started to become accessible to the public thanks to the rise of directroy sites like Yahoo! and tools like Netscape's browser. The brothers were tuned in to the Internet and thought they might like to start a company together doing something on the Web. From California to Colorado, Wyoming, South Dakota, and Illinois, they took turns driving, brainstorming, and talking shit before heading back east to get Musk to school that fall. The best idea to arise from the journey was an online network for doctors. This wasn't meant to be something as ambitious as electronic health records but more of a system for physicians to exchange information and collaborate. "It seemed like the medical industry was one that could be disrupted," Kimbal said. "I went to work on a business plan and the sales and marketing side of it later, but it didn't fly. We didn't love it."

>　Musk had spent the earlier part of that summer in Silicon Valley, holding down a pair of internships. Byday, he worked at Pinnacle Resarch Institute. Based in Los Gatos, Pinnacle was a much-ballyhooed start-up with a team of scientists exploring ways in which ultracapacitors could be used as a revolutionary fuel source in electric and hybird vehicles. The work also veered - at leat conceptually - into  more bizarre territory. Musk could talk at length about how ultracapacitors might be used to build laster based sidearms in the tradition fo Star Wars and just about any other futuristic film. The laser guns would release rounds of enormous energy, and then the shooter would replace an ultracapacitor at the base of the gun, much like swapping out a clip of bullets, and start blasting away again. Ultracapacitors also looked promising as the power supplies of missiles. They were more resilient than batteries under the mechanical stresses of a launch and would hold a more consistent charge over long periods of time. Musk fell in love with the work at Pinnacle and began using it as the basis for some of his business plan experiments at Penn and for his industrialist fantasies.
