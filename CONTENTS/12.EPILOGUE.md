>　Elon Musk is a body that remains very much in motion. By the time this book reaches your hands, it's quite possible that Musk and SpaceX will have managed to land a rocket on a barge at sea or back on a launchpad in Florida. Tesla Motors may have unveiled some of the special features of the Mode X. Musk could have formally declared war on the artificial intelligence machines coming to life inside of Google's data centers. Who knows?

>　What's clear is that Musk's desire to take on more keeps growing. Just as I was putting the finishing touches on this book, Musk unfurled a number of major initiatives. The most dramatic of which is a plan to surround the Earth with thousands of small communications satellites. Musk wants, in effect, to build a spacebased Internet in which the statellites would be close enough to the planet to beam down bandwidth at high speeds. Such a system would be useful for a couple of reasons: In areas too poor or too remote to have fiber-optic connections, it would provide people with high-spped Internet for the first time. It could also function as an efficient backhaul network for businesses and consumers.
