>　Elon Musk is a body that remains very much in motion. By the time this book reaches your hands, it's quite possible that Musk and SpaceX will have managed to land a rocket on a barge at sea or back on a launchpad in Florida. Tesla Motors may have unveiled some of the special features of the Mode X. Musk could have formally declared war on the artificial intelligence machines coming to life inside of Google's data centers. Who knows?

>　What's clear is that Musk's desire to take on more keeps growing. Just as I was putting the finishing touches on this book, Musk unfurled a number of major initiatives. The most dramatic of which is a plan to surround the Earth with thousands of small communications satellites. Musk wants, in effect, to build a spacebased Internet in which the statellites would be close enough to the planet to beam down bandwidth at high speeds. Such a system would be useful for a couple of reasons: In areas too poor or too remote to have fiber-optic connections, it would provide people with high-spped Internet for the first time. It could also function as an efficient backhaul network for businesses and consumers.

>　Musk, of course, also sees this space Internet as key to his long-term ambitions around Mars. "It will be important for Mars to have a global communications network," he said. "I think this needs to be done, and I don't see anyone else doing it." SpaceX will build these satellites at a new factory and will also look to sell more satellites to commercial customers as it perfects the technology. To fund part of this unbelievably ambitious project, SpaceX secured $1 billion from Google and Fidelity. In a rare momnet of restraint, Musk declined to provide anexact delivery date for his space Internet, which he forecasts will cost more than $10 billion to build. "People should not expect this to be active sooner than five years," he said. "But we see it as a long-term revenue source for SpaceX to be able to fund a city on Mars."

The building it acquired was the old Solyndra manufacturing plant - another symbol of Musk's ability to thrive in the green technology industry that has destroyed so many other entrepreneurs. And Tesla continues to build its Gigafactory in Nevada at pace, while its network of charging stations have saved upward of four million gallons of gas. During a quarterly earnings announcement, J.B Straubel promised that Tesla would start producing battery systems for home use in 2015 that would let people hop off the grid for periods of time. Musk then one-upped Straubel, bragging that he thinks Tesla could eventually be more valuable than Apple and could challenge it in the race to be the first $1 trillion compnay. A handful of groups have also set to work building prototype Hyperloop systems in and around California. Oh, and Musk starred in an episode of The Simpsons titled "The Musk Who Fell to Earth," in which Homer became his inventive muse.
