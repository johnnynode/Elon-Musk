ELON'S WORLD
---

ã€€Do you think I'm insane? This question came from Elon Musk near the very end
of a long dinner we shared at a high-end seafood restaurant
in Silicon Valley. I'd gotten to the restaurant first and settled
down with a gin and tonic,knowing Musk would-as ever-be
late. After about fifteen minutes,Musk showed up wearing leather
shoes, designer jeans,and a plaid dress shirt. Musk stands six foot
one but ask anyone who knows him and they'll confirm that he
seems much bigger than that. He's absurdly broad-shouldered,
sturdy,and thick. You'd figure he would use this frame to his
advantage and perform an alpha-male strut when entering a
room. Instead,he tends to be almost sheepish. It's heard tilted
slightly down while walking,a quick handshake hello after reaching
the table,and then butt in seat. From there, Musk needs a few
minutes before he warms up and looks at ease.
