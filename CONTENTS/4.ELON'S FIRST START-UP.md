ELON'S FIRST START-UP.md
---

>　In the summer of 1994. Musk and his brother. Kimbal., took their first steps toward becoming honest-to-God Americans. They set off on a road trip across the country.
>
>　Kimbal had been working as a franchisee for College Pro Painters and done well for himself, running what amounted to a small business. He sold off his part of the franchise and pooled the money with what Musk had on hand to buy a beat-up 1970s BMW 320i. The brothers began their trip near san francisco in August, as temperatures in California soared. The first part of the drive took them down to Needles, a city in the Mojave Desert. There they experienced the sweaty thrill of 120-degree weather in a car with no air-conditioning and learnined to love pit stops at Carl's Jr.burger joints, where they spent hours recuperating in the cold.
