CANADA

>　Musk's great escape to Canada was not well thought out. he knew of a great-uncle in Monreal, hopped on a flight and hoped for the best. Upon landing in June 1988, Musk found a pay phone and tried to use directory assistance to find his uncle. When that didn't work, he called his mother collect. She had bad news. Maye had sent a letter to the uncle before Musk left and received a reply while her son was in transit. The uncle had gone to Minnesota, meaning Musk had nowhere to stay. Bags in hand, Musk headed for a youth hostel.

>　After spending a few days in Montreal exploring the city, Musk tried to come up with a long-term plan. Maye had family scattered all across Canada, and Musk began reaching out to them. He bought a countrywide bus ticket that let him hop on and off as he pleased for one hundred dollars, and opted to head to Saskatchewan, the former home of his grandfather. After a 1,900-mile bus ride, he ended up in Swift Current, a town of fifteen thousand people. Musk called a second cousin out of the blue from the bus station and hitched a ride to his house.

>　Musk spent the next year working a series of odd jobs round Canada. He tended vegetables and shoveled out grain bins at a cousin's farm located in the tiny town of Waldeck. Musk celbrated his eighteenth birthday there, sharing a cake with the family he'd just met and a feew starngers from the neighhorhood. After that, he leaned to cut logs with a chain saw in Vancouver, British Columbia. The hardest job Musk took came after a visit to the unemployment office. He inquired about the job with the best wage, which turned out to be a gig cleaning the boiler room of a lumber mill for eighteen dollars an hour. "You have to put on this hazmat suit and then shimmy through this litle tunnel that you can barely fit in," Musk said. "Then, you have a shovel and you take the sand and goop and other residue, which is still steaming hot, and you have to shovel it through the same hole you came through. There is no escape. Someone else on the other side has to shovel it into a wheelbarrow. If you stay in there for more than thirty minutes, you get too hot and die." Thirty people started out at the beginning of the week. By the third day, five people were left. At the end of the week, it was just Musk and two other men doing the work.

>　As Musk made his way around Canada, his brother, sister, and mother were figuring out how to get there as well. When Kimbal and Elon eventually reunited in Canada, their headstrong, playful natures bloomed. Elon ended up enrolling at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, in 1989. (He picked Queen's over the University of Waterloo because he felt there were more good looking women at Queen's.) Outide of his studies, Elon would read the newspaper alongside Kimbal, and the two of them would identify interesting people they would like to meet. They then took turns cold-calling these people to ask if they were available to have lunch. Among the harassed was the head of marketing for the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team, a business writer for the Globe and Mail, and a top executive at the Bank of Nova Scotia, Peter Nicholso. Nicholson remembered the boys' call well. "I was not in the habit of getting out-of-the-blue requests," he said. "I was perfectly prepared to have lunch with a couple of kids that had that kind of gumption." It took six months to get on Nicholson's calendar, but, sure enough, the Musk brothers made a three hour train ride and showed up on time.

>　Nicholson's first exposure to the Musk brothers left him with an impression many would share. Both presented themselves well and were polite. Elon, though, clealy came off as the geekier, more awkward counterpoint to the charismatic, personable Kimbal. "I became more impressed and fascinated as I talked to htem," Nicholson said. "They were so determined ." NIcholson ended up offering Elon a summer internship at the bank and became his trusted advisor.

>　Not long after their initial meeting, Elon invited Peter Nicholson's daughter Christie to his birthday party. Christie showed up at Maye's Toronto aprartment with a jar of homemade lemon curd in hand and was greeted by Elon and about fiteen other people. Elon had never met Christie before, but he went right up to her and led her to a couch. "Then, I believe the second senence out of his mouth was 'I think a lot about electric cars,'" Christie said. "And then he turned to me and said, 'Do you think about electric cars?'" The conversation left Christie, who is now a science writer, whith the distinct impresson that Musk was handsome, affable, and a tremendous nerd. "For whatever reason, I was so struck by that moment on the sofa," she said. "You could tell that this person was very different. He captivated me in that way."

>　With her angular features and blond hair, Christie fit Musk's type, and the two stayed in touch during Musk's time in Canada. They never really dated, but Christie found Musk ingteresting enough to have lengthy conversations with him on the phone. "One night he told me, 'If there was a way that I could not eat, so I could work more, I would not eat. I wish there was a way to get nutrients without sitting down for a meal.' The enormity of his work ethic at that age and his intensity jumped out. It seemed like one of the more unusual things I had ever heard."

>　A deeper relationship during this stint in Canada arose between Musk and Justine Wilson, a fellow student at Queen's. Leggy with long, brown hair, Wilson radiated romance and sexual energy. Justine had already fallen in love with an older man and then ditched him to go to college. Her next conquest was meant to wear a leather jacket and be a damaged, James Dean sort. As fortune would have it, however, the clean-cut, posh-souonding Musk spotted Wilson on campus and went right to work trying to date her. "She looked pretty great," Musk said. "She was also smart and this intellectual with sort of an edge. She had a black belt in tae kwon do and was semi-bohemian and, you know, like the hot chick on campus." He made his first move just outside of her dorm, where he pretended to have bumped into her by accident and then reminded her that they had met previously at a party. Justine, only one week into school, agreed to Musk's proposal of an ice cream date. When he arrived to pick up Wilson, Musk found a note on the dorm room door, notifying him that he'd been stood up. "It said that she had to go study for an exam and couldn't make it and that she was sorry," Musk said. Musk then hunted down Justine's best friend and did some research, asking where Justine usually studied and what her favorite flavor of ice cream was.Later, as Justine hid in the student center studying Spanish, Musk appeared behind her with a couple of melting chocolate chip ice cream cones in hand.

>　Wilson had dreamed of having a torrid romance with a writer. "I wanted to be Sylvia and Ted," she said. What she fell for instead was a relentless, ambitious geek. The pair attended the same abnormal-psychology class and compared their grades following an exam. Justine notched a 97, Musk a 98. "He wnt back to the professor, and talked his way into the two points he lost and got a hundred," justine said. "It felt like we were always competing." Musk had a romantic side as well. One time he sent Wilson a dozen roses, each with its own note, and he also gifted Wilson a copy of The Prophet filled with handwritten romantic musings."he can sweep you off your feet," Justine said.

>　During their university years, the two youngster were off and on, with Musk having to work hard to keep the relationship going. "She was hip and dated the coolest guys and wasn't interested in Elon at all," Maye said. "So that was hard on him." Musk pursued a couple of other girls, but kept returning to Justine. Any time she acted cool toward him, Musk responed with his usual show of force. "He would call very insistently," she said. "You always knew it was Elon because the phone would never stop ringing. The man does not take no for an answer. You can't blow him off. I do think of him as the Terminator. He locks his gaze on to something and says, 'It shall be mine.' Bit by bit, he won me over."

>　College suited Musk. He worked on being less of a know-it-all, while also finding a group of people who repected his intellectual abilities. The university studnets were less inclined to laugh off or deride his opinionated takes on energy, space and whatever else was captivating him at the moment. Musk had found people who responeded to his ambition rather than mocking it, and he fed on this environment.

>　Naviid Farooq, a Canadian who grew up in Geneva, ended up in Musk's freshamn-year dormitory in the fall of 1990. Both men were placed in the international section where a Canadian student would get paired with a student from overseas. Musk sort of broke the system, since he technically counted as a Canadian but knew almost nothing about his surroundings. "I had a roommate from Hong Kong, and he was a really nice guy," Musk said. "He religiously attended every lecture, which was helpful, since I went to he least number of classes possible." For a time, Musk sold computer parts and full PCs in the dorm to make some extra cash. "I could build something to suit their needs like a tricked-out gaming machine or a simple word processor that cost less than what they could get in a store," Musk said.  "Or if their computer didn't boot properly or had a virus, I'd fix it. I could pretty much solve any problem." Farooq and Musk bonded over their backgrounds living abroad and a shared insterest in strategy board games. "I don't think he makes friends easily, but he is very loyal to those he has," Farrooq said. When the video game Civilization was released, the college chums spent hours building their empire, much to the dismay of Farooq's girlfriend, who was forgotten in another room. "Elon could lose himself for hours on end," Farooq said. The students also relished their loner life-styles. "We are the kinds of people that can be by ourselves at a party and not feel socially weird about it."
