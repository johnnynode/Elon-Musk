THE UNIFIED FIELD THEORY OF ELON MUSK EPILOGUE
---

>　The rive brothers used to be like a technology gang. In the late 1990s, they would jump on skateboards and zip around the streets of Santa Cruz, knocking on the doors of businesses and asking if they needed any help managing their computing systems. The young men, who had all grown up in South Africa with their cousin Elon Musk, soon decided there must be an easier way to hawk their technology smartrs than going door-to-door. The wrote some software that allowed them to take control of their clients's systems from afar and to automate many of the standard tasks that companies required, such as installing updates for applications. The software became the basis of a new company called Everdream, and the brothers promoted their technology in some compelling ways. Billboards went up around Sillicon Valley in which Lyndon Rive, a buff underwater hockey player, stood naked with his pants around his ankles, while holding a computer in front of his crotch. Up above his photo, the tagline for the ad read, "Don't get caught with your systems down."

>　By 2004, Lyndon and his brothers, Peter and Russ, wanted a new challenge - something that not only made them money but, as Lyndon put it, "something that not only made us feel good every single day." Near the end of the summer that year, Lyndon rented an RV and set out with Musk for the Black Rock desert and the madness of Burning Man. The man used to go on adventures all the time when they were kids and looked forward to the long drive as a way to catch up and brainstorm about their businesses. Musk knew that Lyndon and his brothers were angling for something big. While driving, Musk turned to Lyndon and suggested that he look into the solar engery market. Musk had studied it a bit and thought there were some opportunities that others had missed. "He said it was a good place to get into," Lyndon recalled.

>　After arriving at Burning Man, Musk, a regular at the event, and his family went through their standard routines. They set up camp and prepped their art car for a drive. This year, they had cut the roof off a small car, elevated the steering wheel, shifted it to the right so that it was placed near the middle of the vehicle, and replaced the seats with a couch. Musk took a lot of pleasure in driving tghe funky creation. "Elon likes to see the rawness of people there," said Bill Lee, his longtime friend. "It's his version of camping. He wants to go and drive the art cars and see installations and the great light shows. He dances a lot." Musk put on a display of strength and determination at the event as well. There was a wooden pole perhaps thirty feet high with a dancing platform at the top. Dozens of people tried and failed to climb it, and then Musk gave it a go. "His technique was very awkward, and he should not have succeeded," said Lyndon. "But he hugged it and just inched up and inched up until he reached the top."

>　Musk and the Rives left Burning Man enthused. The Rives decided to become experts on the solar industry and find the opportunity in the market. They spent two years studying solar technology and the dynamics of the business, reading research reports, interviewing people, and attending conferences along the way. It was during the Solar Power International conference that the Rive brothers really hit on what their business model might be. Only about two thousand people showed up for the event, and they all fit into a couple of hotel confernece rooms for persentations and panels. During one open discussion session, repressentatives from a handful of the world's largest solar installers were sitting onstage, and the moderator asked what they were doing to make solar panels more affordable for consumers. "They all gave the same answer," Lyndon said. "They said, 'We're waiting for the cost of the panels to drop.' None of them were taking ownership of the problem."
>　
>　At the time, it was not easy for consumers to get solar panels on their houses. You had to be very proactive, acquiring the panels and finding someone else to install them. The consumer paid up front and had to make an educated guess as to whether or not his or her house even got enough shunshine to make the ordeal worthwhile. On top of all this, people were reluctant to buy pannels, knowing that the next year's models would be more efficient.

>　The Rives decided to make buying into the solar proposition much simpler and formed a company called SolarCity in 2006. Unlike other companies, they would not manufacture their own solar panels. Instead they would buy them and then do just about everything else in-house. They built software for analyzing a customers' current energy bill and the position of their house and the amount of sunlight it typically received to determine if solar made sense for the property. They built up their own teams to install the solar panels. And they created a financing system in which the customer did not need to pay anything up front for the panels. The consumer leased the panels over a number of years at a fixed monthly rate. Consumers got a lower bill overall, they were no longer subject to the constantly rising rates of typical utilities, and, if they sold their house, they could pass the contract to the new owner. At the end of the lease, the homeowner could also upgrade to new, more efficient panels. Musk had helped his cousins come up with this structure and become the company's chairman and its largest sharesholder, owning about a thrid of SolarCity.

>　Six years later, SolarCity had become the largest installer of solar panels in the country. The company had lived up to its initial goals and made installing the panels painless. Rivals were rushing to mimic its business model. SolarCity had benefited along the way from a collapse in the price of solar panels, which occurred after Chinese panel manufactures flooded the market with product. It had also expanded its business from consumers to businesses with companies like Intel, Walgreens, and Wal-Mart signing up for large installations. In 2012, SolarCity went public and its shares soared higher in the months that followed. By 2014, SolarCity was valued at close to $7 billion.

>　During the entire period of SolarCity's growth, Silicon Valley had dumped huge amounts of money into green technology companies with mostly disastrous results. There were the automotive flubs liek Fisker and Better Place, and Solyndra, the solar cell maker that conservatives loved to hold up as a cautionary tale of government spending and cronyism run amok. Some of the most famous venture capitalists in history, like John Doerr and vinod Khosla, were ripped apart by the local and national press for their failed green investments. The story was almost always for their failed green investments. The story was almost always the same. People had thrown money at green technology bgecause it seemed like the right thing to do, not because it made business sense. From new kinds of energy storage systems to electric cars and solar panels, the technology never quite lived up to its billing and required too much government funding and too many incentives to create a viable market. Much of this criticism was fair. It's just that there was this Elon Musk guy hanging around who seemed to have figured something out that everyone else had missed. "We had a blanket rule against investing in clean-tech companies for about a decade," said Peter Thiel, the PayPayl cofounder and venture capitalist at Founders Fund. "On the macro level, we were right because clean tech as a sector was quite bad. But on the micro level, it looks like Elon has the two most successful clean-tech companies in the U.S. We would rather explain his success as being a fluke. There's the whole Iron Man thing in which he's presented as a cartoonish businessman this very unusual animal at the zoo. But there is now a degree to which you have to ask whether his success is an indictment on the rest of us who have been working on much more incremental things. To the extent that the world still doubts Elon, I think it's a reflection on the insanity of the world and not on the supposed insanity of Elon."

>　SolarCity, like the rest of Musk's ventures, did not represent a business opportuity so much as it represented a worldview. Musk had decided long ago - in his very rational manner - that solar made sense. Enough solar energy hits the Earth's surface in about an hour to equal a year's worth of worldwide energy consumption from all sources put together. Imporvements in the efficiency of solar panels have been happening at a steady clip. If solar is destined to be mankind's preferred energy source in the future, then this future ought to be brought about as quickly as possible.
