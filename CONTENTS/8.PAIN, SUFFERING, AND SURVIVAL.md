PAIN, SUFFERING, AND SURVIVAL
---

>　As he prepared to begin filming iron man in early 2007. The director Jon Favreau rented out a complex in Los Angeles that once belonged to Hughes Aircraft, the aerospace and defense contractor started about eighty years earlier by Howard Hughes. The facility had a series of interlocking hangars and served as a production office for the movie. It also supplied Robert Downey Jr., who was to play Iron Man and his human creator Tony Stark, with a splash of inspiration. Downey felt nostalgic looking at one of the larger hangars, which had fallen into a state of disrepair. Not too long ago, that building had played host to the big ideas of a big man who shook up industries and did things his own way.
>
>　Downey heard some rumblings about a Hughes-like figure named Elon Musk who had constructed his own, modern-day industrial complex about ten miles away. Instead of visualizing how life might have been for Hughes, Downey could perhaps get a taste of the real thing. He set off in March 2007 for SpaceX's headquarters in El Segundo and wound up receiving a personal tour from Musk. "My mind is not easily blown, but his place and this guy were amazing," Downey said.
>
>　To Downey ,the SpaceX facility looked like a giant, exotic hardware store. Enthusiastic employees were zipping about, finding with an assortment of machines. Young white-collar engineers interacted with blue-collar assembly line workers, and they all semmed to share a genuine excitement for what they were doing. "It felt like a radical start-up compnay," Downey said. After the initial tour, Downey came away pleased that the sets being hummered out at the Hughes factory did have parallels to the SpaceX factory. "Things didn't feel out of place," he said.

>　Beyond the surroundings, Downey really wanted a peek inside Musk's psyche. The men walked, sat in Musk's office, and had lunch. Downey appreciated that Musk was not a foul-smelling, fidgety, coder whack job. What Downey picked up on instead were Musk's "accessible eccentricities" and the feeling that he was an unpretentious sort who could work alongside the people in the factory. Both Musk and Stark were the type of men, according to Downey, who "had seized an idea to live by and something to dedicate themselves to" and were not going to waste a moment.

>　When he returned to the Iron Man production office, Downey asked that Favreau be sure to place a Tesla Roadster in Tony Stark's workshop. On a superficial level, this would symbolize that Stark was so cool and connected that he could get a Roadster before it even went on sale. On a deeper level, the car was to be placed as the nearest object to Stark's desk so that it formed something of a bond between the actor, the character, and Musk. "After meeting Elon and making him real to me, I felt like having his presence in the workshop," Downey said. "They became contemporaries. Elon was someone Tony probably hung out with and partied with or more likely they went on some weird jungle trek together to drink concoctions with the shamans."
>
>　After Iron Man came out, Favreau began talking up Musk's role as the inspiration for Downey's interpretation of Tony Stark. It was a stretch on many levels. Musk is not exactly the type of guy who downs scotch in the back of a Humvee while part of a military convoy in Afghanistan. But the press lapped up the comparison, and Musk started to become more of a public figure. People who sort of knew him as "that PayPal guy" began to think of him as the rich, eccentric businessman behind SpaceX and Tesla.

>　Musk enjoyed his rising profile. It fed his ego and provided some fun. He and Justine bought a house in Bel Air. Their neighbor to one side was Quincy Jones, the music producer, and their other neighbor was Joe Francis, the infamous creator of the Girls Gone Wild videos. Musk and some former PayPal executives, having settled their differences, produced Thank You For Smoking and used Musk's jet in the movie. While not a hard-drinking carouser, Musk took part in the Hollywood nightlife and its social secne. "There were just a lot of parties to go to," said Bill Lee, Musk's close friend. "Elon was neighbors with two quasi-celebrities. Our friends were making movies and through his confluence of our networks, there was something to go out and do every night." In one interview, Musk calculated that his life had become 10 percent playboy and 90 percent engineer. "We had a domestic staff of five; during the day our home transformed into a workplace," Justine wrote in magazine article. "We went to black-tie fundraisers and got the best tables as elite Hollywood nighclubs, with Paris Hilton and Lenardo DiCaprio partying next to us. When Google cofounder Larry Page got married on Richard Branson's private Caribbean island, we were there, hanging out in a villa with John Cusack and watching Bono pose with swarms of adoring women outside the reception tent."

>　Justine apprared to relish their status even more than Musk. A writer of fantasy fiction novels, she kept a blog detailing the couple's family life and their adventures on the town. In one entry, Justine had Musk saying that he'd perfer to sleep with Veronica than Betty from the Archie comics and that he'd like to visit a Chuck E. Cheese sometime. In another entry, she wrote about meeting Leonardo DiCaprio at a club and having him beg for a free Tesla Roadster, only to be turned down. Justine handed out nicknames to oft-occurring characters in the blog, so Bill Lee became "Bill the Hotel Guy" becuase he owns a hotel in the Dominican Republic, and Joe Francis appeared as "Notorious Neighbor." It's hard to imagine Musk, who keeps to himeself, hanging out with someone as ostentatious as Francis, but the man got along well. When Francis took over an amusement park for his birthday, Musk attended and then ended up partying at Francis's house. Just wrote, "E was there for a bit but admitted he also found it 'kind of lame' - he's been to a couple of parties at NN's house now and ends up feeling self-conscious, 'because it just seems like there are always these skeevy guys wandering around the house trolling for girls. I don't want to be seen as one of those guys.'" When Francis got ready to buy a Roadster, he stopped by the Musk's house and handed over a yellow envelope with $100,000 in cash.

>　For a while, the blog provided a rare, welcome glimpse into the life of an unconventional CEO. Musk seemed charming. The public learned that he bought Justine a nineteenth-century edition of Pride and Prejudice, that Musk's best friends gave him the nickname "Elonius," and that Musk likes to place one-dollar wagers on all manner of things - Can you catch herpes from the Great Barrier Reef? Is it possible to balance two forks with a toothpick? - that he knows he will win. Justine told one story about Musk traveling to Necker Island, in the British Virgin Islands, to hang out with Tony Blair and Richard Branson. A photo of the three men appeared later in the press that depicted Musk with a vacent stare. "This was E's I'm-thinking-about-a-rocket-problem stance, which makes me pretty sure that he had just gotten some kind of bothersome work-related e-mail, and was clearly oblivious to the fact that a picture was being taken at all," she wrote. "This is also the reason I get suck [sic] a kick out of it - the spouse the camera caught is the exact spouse I encountered, say, last night en route to the bathroom, standing in the hallway frowning with his arms folded." Justine letting the world into the couple's bathroom should have served as a warning of things to come. Her blog would soon turn into one of Musk's worst nightmares.

>　The press had not run into a guy like Musk for a very long time. His shine as an Internet millionaire kept getting, well, shinier thanks to PayPal's ongoing success. He also had an element of mystery. There was the weird name. And there was the willingness to spend vast sums of money on spaceships and electric cars, which came across as a combination of daring, flamboyant, and downright flabbergasting. "Elon Musk has been called 'part playboy, part space cowboy,' and image hardly dispelled by a car collection that has boasted a Porsche 911 Turbo, 1967 Series 1 Jaguar, a Hamann BMW M5 plus the aforementioned McLaren F1 - which he has driven at up to 215mph on a private airstrip," a British reporter gushed in 2007. "Then there was the L39 Soviet military jet, which he sold after becoming a father." The press had picked up on the fact that Musk tended to talk a huge game and then struggle to deliver on his promises in time, but they didn't much care. The game he talked was so much bigger than anyone else's that reporters were comfortable giving Musk leeway. Tesla became the darling of Silicon Valley's bloggers, who tracked its every move and were breathless in their coverage. Similaryly, reporters convering SpaceX were overjoyed that a young, feisty company had arrived to needle Boeing, Lockheed, and , to a large extent, NASA. All Musk had to do was eventually bring some of these wondrous things he'd been funding to market.

>　While Musk put on a good show for the public and press, he'd started to get very worried about his businesses. SpaceX's second launch attempt had failed, and the reports coming in from Tesla kept getting worse. Musk had started these two adventures with a fortune nearing $200 million and had chewed through more than half the money with little to show for it. As each Tesla delay turned into a PR fiasco, the Musk's glow dimmed. People in Silicon Valley began to gossip about Musk's money problems. Reporters who months earlier had been heaping adulation on Musk turned on him. The New York Times picked up on Tesla's transmission problems. Automotive websites griped that the Roadster might never ship. By the end of 2007, things got downright nasty. Valleywag, Silicon Valley's gossip blog, began to take a particular interest in Musk. Owen Thomas, the site's lead writer, dug into the histories of Zip2 and PayPal and played up the times Musk was ousted as CEO to undermine some of his entrepreneurial street cred. Thomas then championed the premise that Musk was a master manipulator who played fast and loose with other people's money. "It's wonderful that Musk has realized even a small part of his childhood fantasies," Thomas wrote. "But he risks destroying his dreams by refusing to reconcile them with reality." Valleywag anointed the Tesla Roadster as its No.1 fail of 2007 among technology companies.

>　As his businesses and public persona suffered, Musk's home life degraded as well. His triplets - Kai, Damian, and Saxon - had arrived near the end of 2006 and joined their brothers Griffin and Xavier. According to Musk, Justine suffered from postpartum depression following the birth of the triplets. "In the spring of 2007, our manage was having real issues," Musk said. "It was on the rocks." Justine's blog posts back up his sentiments. She described a much less romantic Musk and felt people treated her as "an arm ornament who couldn't possibly have anything interesting to say" rather than as an author and here husband's equal. During one trip to St.Barts, the Musks ended up sharing dinner with some wealthy, infuential couples. When justine let out her political views, one of the men at the table made a crack about her being so opinionated. "E chuckled back, patted my hand the way you pat a child's," Justine ordered Musk to introduce her as a published novelist and not just his wife and mother of his children. The results? "E's way of doing this throughout the rest of the trip: 'Justine wants me to tell you that she's written novels,' which made people look at me oh, that's just so cute and didn't really help my case."

>　As 2007 rolled into 2008, Musk's life became more tumultuous. Tesla basically had to start over on much of the Roadster, and SpaceX still had dozens of people living in Kwajalein awaiting the next launch of the Falcon 1. Both endeavors were vacuuming up Musk's money. He started selling off prized possessions like the McLaren to generate extra cash. Musk tended to shield employees from the gravity of his fiscal situation by always encouraging them to do their best work. At the same time, he personally oversaw all significant purchases at both companies. Musk also trained employees to make the right trade-offsbetween spending money and productivity. This struck many of the SpaceX employees as a novel idea, since they were used to traditional aerospace companies that had huge, multiyear government contracts and no day-to-day survival peressure. "Elon would always be at work on Sunday, and we had some chats where he laid out his philosophy," said Kevin Brogan, the early SpaceX employee. "He would say that everything we did was a function of our burn rate and that we were burning through a hundred thousand dollars per day. It was this very entrepreneurial, Silicon Valley way of thinking that none of the aerospace engineers in Los Angeles were dialed into. Sometimes he wouldn't let you buy a part for two thousand dollars because he expected you to find it cheaper or invent something cheaper. Other times, he wouldn't flinch at renting a plane for ninety thousand dollars to get something to Kwaj because it saved an entire workday, so it was worth it. He would placed this urgency that he expected the revenue in ten years to be ten million dollars a day and that every day we were slower to achieve our goals was a day of missing out on that money."

>　Musk had become all consumed with Tesla and SpaceX out of necessity, and there can be no doubt that this exacerbated the tensions in his marriage. The Musks had a team of nannies to help with their five children, but Elon could not spend much time at home. He worked seven days a week and quite often split his time between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Justine needed a change. During moments of self-reflection, she felt sickened, perceiving herself a trophy wife. Justine longed to be Elon's partner again and to feel some of that spark from their early days before life had turned so dazzling and demanding. It's not clear how much Musk let on to Justine about his dwindling bank account. She has long maintained that Musk kept her in the dark about the family's financial arrangements. But some of Musk's closest friends did get a glimpse into the worsening financial situation. In the first half of 2008, Antonio Gracias, the founder and CEO of Valor Equity, met Musk for dinner. Gracias had been an investor in Tesla and had become one of Musk's closest friends and allies, and he could see Musk agonizing over his future. "Things were starting to be difficult with Justine, but they were still together," Gracias said. "During that dinner, Elon said, 'I will spend my last dollar on these companies. If we have to move into Justine's parents' basement, we'll do it.'"
